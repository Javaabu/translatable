- **PHP:** Version 8.2 or higher

Additionally, this package relies on the following dependencies:

- `illuminate/support`: ^9.0 || ^10.0 || ^11.0 || ^12.0
- `javaabu/helpers`: ^1.61

And for development, you'll need:

We also suggest using `javaabu/forms` for the little buttons and table cells that are provided.
