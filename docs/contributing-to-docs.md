# Contributing to the Docs

We believe that documentation is just as important as code, and we're always looking for ways to improve it. If you find any issues with our documentation, or if you have any suggestions for how we can make it better, we'd love to hear from you.

If you're interested in contributing to the documentation, you can do so by submitting a pull request to the [Translatable repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Javaabu/translatable). The documentation is located in the `/docs` directory, and it's written in Markdown.

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to generate our documentation website, so you can use all of the features that Docusaurus provides, such as:

- [Markdown Front Matter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#front-matter)
- [Admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions)
- [Sidebar Metadata](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata)

We appreciate your help in making our documentation the best it can be!
